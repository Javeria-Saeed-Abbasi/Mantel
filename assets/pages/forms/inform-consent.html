                                            Welcome to Accepted Therapy Services. This document contains important
                                            information about our professional services and business policies. Although
                                            these documents are long and sometimes complex, it is very important that
                                            you understand them. When you sign this document, it will also represent an
                                            agreement between us. If you have any questions, we can discuss them prior
                                            to you signing the document; however, no therapy services will be provided
                                            until a signed copy of this document has been received.

                                            The first 2-4 sessions will involve establishing a relationship, developing
                                            treatment goals, and creating an initial treatment plan. During this time, I
                                            will have an opportunity to get to know my therapist and to make my own
                                            assessment about whether I feel comfortable working with them. If I have
                                            questions about the procedures that are outlined in this document, I will
                                            discuss them whenever they arise. If my doubts persist, I will ask my
                                            therapist to help me set up a meeting with another mental health
                                            professional for a second opinion.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Psychotherapy requires a very active effort on my part. In order to be most
                                            successful, I may have to work on things that are discussed outside of
                                            sessions. This may be through homework which, if assigned, will be specific
                                            to the work that I am doing in sessions. Any homework assignment that is
                                            given to me, will be tailored to my experiences and current level of coping
                                            or functioning.
                                        </p>

                                                The benefits of therapy can include:
                                            <ul class="">
                                                <li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the benefits of therapy is having someone that I can talk
                                                        to and who is on my side. Sometimes, my therapist may challenge
                                                        or
                                                        push me to improve in a certain area. I understand that this
                                                        pushing
                                                        or challenging is for my benefit so that I may change the areas
                                                        that
                                                        are preventing me from having a life worth living. Sometimes,
                                                        having
                                                        someone to help me carry my burdens is helpful.

                                                            Therapy requires an extreme sense of vulnerability and
                                                            looking
                                                            at painful experiences. As these experiences are remembered,

                                                            Because therapy often focuses on unpleasant and painful
                                                            issues, it may seem like things are getting worse. Remember
                                                            that
                                                            things often get worse before they improve.

                                                additional fee of up to $50.00 to cover the bank fee that is incurred.
                                                If I refuse to pay my debt, of any fees that are owed to Accepted

                                                require such as report writing, telephone conversations that last longer
                                                than 15 minutes, meetings or consultations which I have requested my
                                                therapist to attend, or the time required to perform any other service

                                            In order for us to set realistic treatment goals and priorities, it is
                                            important to evaluate what resources I have available to pay for my
                                            treatment. If I have a health insurance policy, it will usually provide some
                                            coverage for mental health treatment. With my permission, my therapist will
                                            assist me to the extent possible in filing claims if she is an in-network
                                            provider for my insurance. I understand that I am responsible for knowing my
                                            coverage (including co-insurance and co-pays) and for letting Accepted
                                            Therapy Service know if/when my coverage changes. If my therapist is not a
                                            participating provider for my insurance plan, I understand that she will
                                            supply me with a receipt of payment or superbill, upon request, for services
                                            which I can submit to my insurance company for reimbursement. Please note
                                            that not all insurance companies reimburse for out-of-network providers. If
                                            I prefer to use a participating provider, my therapist will refer me to
                                            another mental health professional.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I am aware that most insurance companies require my therapist to provide
                                            them with a clinical diagnosis/diagnoses. (Diagnoses are technical terms
                                            that describe the nature of my problems and whether they are short-term or
                                            long-term problems. All diagnoses come from a book entitled the Diagnostic
                                            and Statistical Manuel 5th Edition or DSM-5. There is a copy in my
                                            therapist’s office that I can look at if I would like to learn more about my
                                            diagnosis, if applicable.). Sometimes my therapist may have to provide
                                            additional clinical information such as treatment plans or summaries, or
                                            copies of the entire record (in rare cases). This information will become
                                            part of the insurance company files and will probably be stored in a
                                            computer. Though all insurance companies claim to keep such information
                                            confidential, I recognize that my therapist does not have control over what
                                            the insurance company does with it once it is in their hands. In some cases,
                                            they may share the information with a national medical information databank.
                                            If I want a copy of any report my therapist submits, I can request it at any
                                            time. By signing this agreement, you agree that I can provide requested
                                            information to your carrier if you plan to pay with insurance.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In addition, if I plan to use my insurance, authorization from the insurance
                                            company may be required before they will cover therapy fees. If I do obtain
                                            authorization and it is required, I may be responsible for full payment of
                                            any fees accrued. Many policies leave a percentage of the fee (which is
                                            called co-insurance) or a flat dollar amount (referred to as a co-payment)
                                            to be covered by me (the client). Either amount is to be paid at the time of
                                            the visit via any of the accepted payment methods. In addition, some
                                            insurance companies also have a deductible, which is an out-of-pocket
                                            amount, that must be paid by me (the client) before the insurance company is
                                            willing to begin paying any amount for services. This will typically mean
                                            that I will be responsible to pay for initial sessions with my therapist
                                            until my deductible has been met. The deductible amount may also need to be
                                            met at the start of each calendar year. Once we have all of the information
                                            about your insurance coverage, we will discuss what we can reasonably expect
                                            to accomplish with the benefits that are available and what will happen if
                                            coverage ends before I feel ready to end my sessions. I understand that I
                                            always have the right to pay for my therapy services out-of-pocket if I wish
                                            to avoid any of the problems described above.

                                            I understand that my therapist is required to keep appropriate records of
                                            the therapy services that are provided. My records are maintained in a
                                            secure electronic medical record (EMR) through TheraNest. The records kept
                                            in my EMR may include information such as: dates of services, reasons for

                                            I have access to my records in most instances, upon request, unless there
                                            are unusual circumstances that may result in emotional distress or harm me
                                            if were to review my records. Because these are professional records, there
                                            is a chance that they may be misinterpreted and/or upsetting to untrained
                                            readers. For this reason, it is recommended that if I wish to review my
                                            records, I initially review them with my therapist or have them forwarded to
                                            another mental health professional to discuss the contents. If my therapist
                                            refuses my request for access to my records, I have a right to have her
                                            decision reviewed by another mental health professional, which will be
                                            discussed with me upon my request. I also have the right to request that a
                                            copy of my file be made available to any other health care provider at my
                                            written request.

                                            I understand that my therapist does not routinely disclose information in
